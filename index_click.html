    "question": "A security analyst is reviewing alerts in the SIEM related to potential malicious network traffic coming from an employee's corporate laptop. The security analyst has determined that additional data about the executable running on the machine is necessary to continue the investigation. Which of the following logs should the analyst use as a data source?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Application",
      "B": "IPS/IDS",
      "C": "Network",
      "D": "Endpoint"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Endpoint logs are the most suitable data source for gathering additional information about the executable running on the employee's corporate laptop. These logs contain detailed information about processes, executables, and activities occurring on the endpoint, enabling the security analyst to understand the behavior of the executable and its potential impact on the system and network."
  },
  {
    "questionNumber": 2,
    "question": "A cyber operations team informs a security analyst about a new tactic malicious actors are using to compromise networks. SIEM alerts have not yet been configured. Which of the following best describes what the security analyst should do to identify this behavior?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Digital forensics",
      "B": "E-discovery",
      "C": "Incident response",
      "D": "Threat hunting"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Threat hunting is the process of proactively searching for signs of malicious activity or compromise in a network, rather than waiting for alerts or indicators of compromise (IOCs) to appear. Threat hunting can help identify new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious actors, as well as uncover hidden or stealthy threats that may have evaded detection by security tools. Threat hunting requires a combination of skills, tools, and methodologies, such as hypothesis generation, data collection and analysis, threat intelligence, and incident response. Threat hunting can also help improve the security posture of an organization by providing feedback and recommendations for security improvements."
  },
  {
    "questionNumber": 3,
    "question": "A company purchased cyber insurance to address items listed on the risk register. Which of the following strategies does this represent?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Accept",
      "B": "Transfer",
      "C": "Mitigate",
      "D": "Avoid"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Transfer: Transferring a risk involves shifting some or all of the risk to another party, such as an insurance provider, through contractual agreements or financial arrangements. If the company purchases cyber insurance to address items listed on the risk register, it represents a risk transfer strategy. The company is transferring the financial burden of potential cyber incidents to the insurance provider, who will compensate the company for covered losses. Given the scenario described, the strategy represented by the company's purchase of cyber insurance to address items listed on the risk register is Transfer. The company is transferring some of the financial consequences of potential cyber incidents to the insurance provider through the purchase of insurance coverage."

    "questionNumber": 4,
    "question": "A security administrator would like to protect data on employees' laptops. Which of the following encryption techniques should the security administrator use?",

      "A": "Partition",
      "B": "Asymmetric",
      "C": "Full disk",
      "D": "Database"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Full disk encryption (FDE) encrypts all the data on a disk drive, protecting the data at rest on the entire laptop, including the operating system, applications, and user files. This ensures that if a laptop is lost or stolen, the data cannot be accessed without the correct decryption key."
  },
  {
    "questionNumber": 5,
    "question": "Which of the following security control types does an acceptable use policy best represent?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Detective",
      "B": "Compensating",
      "C": "Corrective",
      "D": "Preventive"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Preventive - an acceptable use policy enforces rules to users to use company resources. example - company A states that in order to access files in the company server you must connect to your company VPN when working from home. This prevents you from connecting from an insecure network."
  },
  {
    "questionNumber": 6,
    "question": "An IT manager informs the entire help desk staff that only the IT manager and the help desk lead will have access to the administrator console of the help desk software. Which of the following security techniques is the IT manager setting up?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hardening",
      "B": "Employee monitoring",
      "C": "Configuration enforcement",
      "D": "Least privilege"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The principle of least privilege is a security concept that limits access to resources to the minimum level needed for a user, a program, or a device to perform a legitimate function. It is a cybersecurity best practice that protects high-value data and assets from compromise or insider threat. Least privilege can be applied to different abstraction layers of a computing environment, such as processes, systems, or connected devices. However, it is rarely implemented in practice. In this scenario, the IT manager is setting up the principle of least privilege by restricting access to the administrator console of the help desk software to only two authorized users: the IT manager and the help desk lead. This way, the IT manager can prevent unauthorized or accidental changes to the software configuration, data, or functionality by other help desk staff. The other help desk staff will only have access to the normal user interface of the software, which is sufficient for them to perform their job functions. The other options are not correct. Hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability, such as by removing unnecessary software, changing default passwords, or disabling unnecessary services. Employee monitoring is the surveillance of workers' activity, such as by tracking web browsing, application use, keystrokes, or screenshots. Configuration enforcement is the process of ensuring that a system adheres to a predefined set of security settings, such as by applying a patch, a policy, or a template."

      "B": "Third-party vendor",
      "C": "Cloud provider",
      "D": "DBA"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "According to the shared responsibility model, the client and the cloud provider have different roles and responsibilities for securing the cloud environment, depending on the service model. In an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model, the cloud provider is responsible for securing the physical infrastructure, such as the servers, storage, and network devices, while the client is responsible for securing the operating systems, applications, and data that run on the cloud infrastructure. Therefore, the client is responsible for securing the company's database in an IaaS model for a cloud environment, as the database is an application that stores data. The client can use various security controls, such as encryption, access control, backup, and auditing, to protect the database from unauthorized access, modification, or loss. The third-party vendor and the DBA (Database Administrator) are not roles defined by the shared responsibility model, but they may be involved in the implementation or management of the database security."

    "question": "A client asked a security company to provide a document outlining the project, the cost, and the completion time frame. Which of the following documents should the company provide to the client?",
    "options": {
      "A": "MSA",
      "B": "SLA",
      "C": "BPA",
      "D": "SOW"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An ISOW is a document that outlines the project, the cost, and the completion time frame for a security company to provide a service to a client. ISOW stands for Information Security Operations Work, and it is a type of contract that specifies the scope, deliverables, milestones, and payment terms of a security project. An ISOW is usually used for one-time or short-term projects that have a clear and defined objective and outcome. For example, an ISOW can be used for a security assessment, a penetration test, a security audit, or a security training. The other options are not correct because they are not documents that outline the project, the cost, and the completion time frame for a security company to provide a service to a client. A MSA is a master service agreement, which is a type of contract that establishes the general terms and conditions for a long-term or ongoing relationship between a security company and a client. A MSA does not specify the details of each individual project, but rather sets the framework for future projects that will be governed by separate statements of work (SOWs). A SLA is a service level agreement, which is a type of contract that defines the quality and performance standards for a security service provided by a security company to a client. A SLA usually includes the metrics, targets, responsibilities, and penalties for measuring and ensuring the service level. A BPA is a business partnership agreement, which is a type of contract that establishes the roles and expectations for a strategic alliance between two or more security companies that collaborate to provide a joint service to a client. A BPA usually covers the objectives, benefits, risks, and obligations of the partnership."

    "question": "A security team is reviewing the findings in a report that was delivered after a third party performed a penetration test. One of the findings indicated that a web application form field is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Which of the following application security techniques should the security analyst recommend the developer implement to prevent this vulnerability?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Secure cookies",
      "B": "Version control",
      "C": "Input validation",
      "D": "Code signing"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Input validation is a technique that checks the user input for any malicious or unexpected data before processing it by the web application. Input validation can prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which exploit the vulnerability of a web application to execute malicious scripts in the browser of a victim. XSS attacks can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the web application and its users. Input validation can be implemented on both the client-side and the server-side, but server-side validation is more reliable and secure. Input validation can use various methods, such as whitelisting, blacklisting, filtering, escaping, encoding, and sanitizing the input data."

      "C": "To eradicate any trace of malware on the network",
      "D": "To prevent future incidents of the same nature"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Root cause analysis is a process of identifying and resolving the underlying factors that led to an incident. By conducting root cause analysis as part of incident response, security professionals can learn from the incident and implement corrective actions to prevent future incidents of the same nature. For example, if the root cause of a data breach was a weak password policy, the security team can enforce a stronger password policy and educate users on the importance of password security. Root cause analysis can also help to improve security processes, policies, and procedures, and to enhance security awareness and culture within the organization. Root cause analysis is not meant to gather loCs (indicators of compromise) for the investigation, as this is a task performed during the identification and analysis phases of incident response. Root cause analysis is also not meant to discover which systems have been affected or to eradicate any trace of malware on the network, as these are tasks performed during the containment and eradication phases of incident response."

      "B": "Sanitization",
      "C": "Destruction",
      "D": "Inventory"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sanitization is the process of removing sensitive data from a storage device or a system before it is disposed of or reused. Sanitization can be done by using software tools or hardware devices that overwrite the data with random patterns or zeros, making it unrecoverable. Sanitization is different from destruction, which is the physical damage of the storage device to render it unusable. Sanitization is also different from enumeration, which is the identification of network resources or devices, and inventory, which is the tracking of assets and their locations. The policy of securely wiping hard drives before sending decommissioned systems to recycling is an example of sanitization, as it ensures that no confidential data can be retrieved from the recycled devices."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "An application allow list is a security technique that specifies which applications are permitted to run on a system or a network. An application allow list can block unknown programs from executing by only allowing the execution of programs that are explicitly authorized and verified. An application allow list can prevent malware, unauthorized software, or unwanted applications from running and compromising the security of the system or the network. The other options are not the best ways to block unknown programs from executing: Access control list: This is a security technique that specifies which users or groups are granted or denied access to a resource or an object. An access control list can control the permissions and privileges of users or groups, but it does not directly block unknown programs from executing. Host-based firewall: This is a security device that monitors and filters the incoming and outgoing network traffic on a single host or system. A host-based firewall can block or allow network connections based on predefined rules, but it does not directly block unknown programs from executing. DLP solution: This is a security system that detects and prevents the unauthorized transmission or leakage of sensitive data. A DLP solution can protect the confidentiality and integrity of data, but it does not directly block unknown programs from executing."

    "explanation": "A honey pot is a system or a network that is designed to mimic a real production server and attract potential attackers. A honey pot can be used to identify the attacker's methods, techniques, and objectives without affecting the actual production servers. A honey pot can also divert the attacker's attention from the real targets and waste their time and resources. The other options are not effective ways to identify potential attacker activities without affecting production servers: Video surveillance: This is a physical security technique that uses cameras and monitors to record and observe the activities in a certain area. Video surveillance can help to deter, detect, and investigate physical intrusions, but it does not directly identify the attacker's activities on the network or the servers. Zero Trust: This is a security strategy that assumes that no user, device, or network is trustworthy by default and requires strict verification and validation for every request and transaction. Zero Trust can help to improve the security posture and reduce the attack surface of an organization, but it does not directly identify the attacker's activities on the network or the servers. Geofencing: This is a security technique that uses geographic location as a criterion to restrict or allow access to data or resources. Geofencing can help to protect the data sovereignty and compliance of an organization, but it does not directly identify the attacker's activities on the network or the servers."

      "C": "Update the EDR policies to block automatic execution of downloaded programs.",
      "D": "Create additional training for users to recognize the signs of phishing attempts."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "An endpoint detection and response (EDR) system is a security tool that monitors and analyzes the activities and behaviors of endpoints, such as computers, laptops, mobile devices, and servers. An EDR system can detect, prevent, and respond to various types of threats, such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). One of the features of an EDR system is to block the automatic execution of downloaded programs, which can prevent malicious code from running on the endpoint when a user clicks on a link in a phishing message. This can reduce the impact of a phishing attack and protect the endpoint from compromise. Updating the EDR policies to block automatic execution of downloaded programs is a technical control that can mitigate the risk of phishing, regardless of the user's awareness or behavior. Therefore, this is the best answer among the given options. The other options are not as effective as updating the EDR policies, because they rely on administrative or physical controls that may not be sufficient to prevent or stop a phishing attack. Placing posters around the office to raise awareness of common phishing activities is a physical control that can increase the user's knowledge of phishing, but it may not change their behavior or prevent them from clicking on a link in a phishing message. Implementing email security filters to prevent phishing emails from being delivered is an administrative control that can reduce the exposure to phishing, but it may not be able to block all phishing emails, especially if they are crafted to bypass the filters. Creating additional training for users to recognize the signs of phishing attempts is an administrative control that can improve the user's skills of phishing detection, but it may not guarantee that they will always be vigilant or cautious when receiving an email. Therefore, these options are not the best answer for this question."

A compensating control does not prevent or eliminate the vulnerability or weakness, but it can reduce the likelihood or impact of an attack. A host-based firewall on a legacy Linux system that allows connections from only specific internal IP addresses is an example of a compensating control, as it can limit the exposure of the system to potential threats from external or unauthorized sources. A host-based firewall is a software application that monitors and filters the incoming and outgoing network traffic on a single host, based on a set of rules or policies. A legacy Linux system is an older version of the Linux operating system that may not be compatible with the latest security updates or patches, and may have known vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers."

      "C": "Escalation script",
      "D": "User provisioning script"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A user provisioning script is an automation technique that uses a predefined set of instructions or commands to create, modify, or delete user accounts and assign appropriate access or permissions. A user provisioning script can help to streamline account creation by reducing manual errors, ensuring consistency and compliance, and saving time and resources. The other options are not automation techniques that can streamline account creation: Guard rail script: This is a script that monitors and enforces the security policies and rules on a system or a network. A guard rail script can help to prevent unauthorized or malicious actions, such as changing security settings, accessing restricted resources, or installing unwanted software. Ticketing workflow: This is a process that tracks and manages the requests, issues, or incidents that are reported by users or customers. A ticketing workflow can help to improve the communication, collaboration, and resolution of problems, but it does not automate the account creation process. Escalation script: This is a script that triggers an alert or a notification when a certain condition or threshold is met or exceeded. An escalation script can help to inform the relevant parties or authorities of a critical situation, such as a security breach, a performance degradation, or a service outage."

    "options": {
      "A": "Corrective",
      "B": "Preventive",
      "C": "Detective",
      "D": "Deterrent"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A detective control is a type of control that monitors and analyzes the events and activities in a system or a network, and alerts or reports when an incident or a violation occurs. A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system is a tool that collects, correlates, and analyzes the logs from various sources, such as firewalls, routers, servers, or applications, and provides a centralized view of the security status and incidents. An analyst who reviews the logs on a weekly basis can identify and investigate any anomalies, trends, or patterns that indicate a potential threat or a breach. A detective control can help the company to respond quickly and effectively to the incidents, and to improve its security posture and resilience."

      "A": "Tuning",
      "B": "Aggregating",
      "C": "Quarantining",
      "D": "Archiving"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Tuning is the activity of adjusting the configuration or parameters of a security tool or system to optimize its performance and reduce false positives or false negatives. Tuning can help to filter out the normal or benign activity that is detected by the security tool or system, and focus on the malicious or anomalous activity that requires further investigation or response. Tuning can also help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the security operations center by reducing the workload and alert fatigue of the analysts. Tuning is different from aggregating, which is the activity of collecting and combining data from multiple sources or sensors to provide a comprehensive view of the security posture. Tuning is also different from quarantining, which is the activity of isolating a potentially infected or compromised device or system from the rest of the network to prevent further damage or spread. Tuning is also different from archiving, which is the activity of storing and preserving historical data or records for future reference or compliance. The act of ignoring detected activity in the future that is deemed normal by the security operations center is an example of tuning, as it involves modifying the settings or rules of the security tool or system to exclude the activity from the detection scope. Therefore, this is the best answer among the given options."

      "D": "Ransomware has been deployed in the domain."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Brute force is a type of attack that tries to guess the password or other credentials of a user account by using a large number of possible combinations. An attacker can use automated tools or scripts to perform a brute force attack and gain unauthorized access to the account. The domain activity logs show that the user ismith has failed to log in 10 times in a row within a short period of time, which is a strong indicator of a brute force attack. The logs also show that the source IP address of the failed logins is different from the usual IP address of ismith, which suggests that the attacker is using a different device or location to launch the attack. The security analyst should take immediate action to block the attacker's IP address, reset ismith's password, and notify ismith of the incident."

      "B": "Geographic dispersion",
      "C": "Load balancers",
      "D": "Off-site backups"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Geographic dispersion is a strategy that involves distributing the servers or data centers across different geographic locations. Geographic dispersion can help the company to mitigate the risk of weather events causing damage to the server room and downtime, as well as improve the availability, performance, and resilience of the network. Geographic dispersion can also enhance the disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities of the company, as it can provide backup and failover options in case of a regional outage or disruption. The other options are not the best ways to address the company's concern: Clustering servers: This is a technique that involves grouping multiple servers together to act as a single system. Clustering servers can help to improve the performance, scalability, and fault tolerance of the network, but it does not protect the servers from physical damage or downtime caused by weather events, especially if the servers are located in the same room or building. Load balancers: These are devices or software that distribute the network traffic or workload among multiple servers or resources. Load balancers can help to optimize the utilization, efficiency, and reliability of the network, but they do not prevent the servers from being damaged or disrupted by weather events, especially if the servers are located in the same room or building. Off-site backups: These are copies of data or files that are stored in a different location than the original source. Off-site backups can help to protect the data from being lost or corrupted by weather events, but they do not prevent the servers from being damaged or disrupted by weather events, nor do they ensure the availability or continuity of the network services."

    "explanation": "A legal hold (also known as a litigation hold) is a notification sent from an organization's legal team to employees instructing them not to delete electronically stored information (ESI) or discard paper documents that may be relevant to a new or imminent legal case. A legal hold is intended to preserve evidence and prevent spoliation, which is the intentional or negligent destruction of evidence that could harm a party's case. A legal hold can be triggered by various events, such as a lawsuit, a regulatory investigation, or a subpoena. In this scenario, the company's attorneys have requested that the security team initiate a legal hold in response to the lawsuit filed by the customers after the company was compromised. This means that the security team will most likely be required to retain any communications related to the security breach until further notice. This could include emails, instant messages, reports, logs, memos, or any other documents that could be relevant to the lawsuit. The security team should also inform the relevant custodians (the employees who have access to or control over the ESI) of their preservation obligations and monitor their compliance. The security team should also document the legal hold process and its scope, as well as take steps to protect the ESI from alteration, deletion, or loss."

      "C": "Watering-hole",
      "D": "Smishing"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A watering-hole attack is a type of cyberattack that targets groups of users by infecting websites that they commonly visit. The attackers exploit vulnerabilities to deliver a malicious payload to the organization's network. The attack aims to infect users' computers and gain access to a connected corporate network. The attackers target websites known to be popular among members of a particular organization or demographic. The attack differs from phishing and spearphishing attacks, which typically attempt to steal data or install malware onto users' devices1 In this scenario, the compromised industry blog is the watering hole that the attackers used to spread malware across the company's network. The attackers likely chose this blog because they knew that the employees of the company were interested in its content and visited it frequently. The attackers may have injected malicious code into the blog or redirected the visitors to a spoofed website that hosted the malware. The malware then infected the employees' computers and propagated to the network."

      "D": "Enabling full packet capture for traffic entering and exiting the servers"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Full packet capture is a technique that records all network traffic passing through a device, such as a router or firewall. It allows for detailed analysis and investigation of network events, such as SQLi attacks, by providing the complete content and context of the packets. Full packet capture can help identify the source, destination, payload, and timing of an SQLi attack, as well as the impact on the server and database. Logging NetFlow traffic, network traffic sensors, and endpoint and OS-specific security logs can provide some information about network activity, but they do not capture the full content of the packets, which may limit the scope and depth of the investigation."

      "B": "Masking",
      "C": "Data classification",
      "D": "Permission restrictions"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Encryption at rest is a strategy that protects data stored on a device, such as a laptop, by converting it into an unreadable format that can only be accessed with a decryption key or password. Encryption at rest can prevent data loss on stolen laptops by preventing unauthorized access to the data, even if the device is physically compromised. Encryption at rest can also help comply with data privacy regulations and standards that require data protection. Masking, data classification, and permission restrictions are other strategies that can help protect data, but they may not be sufficient or applicable for data stored on laptops. Masking is a technique that obscures sensitive data elements, such as credit card numbers, with random characters or symbols, but it is usually used for data in transit or in use, not at rest. Data classification is a process that assigns labels to data based on its sensitivity and business impact, but it does not protect the data itself. Permission restrictions are rules that define who can access, modify, or delete data, but they may not prevent unauthorized access if the laptop is stolen and the security controls are bypassed."

      "D": "Connecting the remote server to the domain and increasing the password length"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A VPN is a virtual private network that creates a secure tunnel between two or more devices over a public network. A VPN can encrypt and authenticate the data, as well as hide the IP addresses and locations of the devices. A jump server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a user and a target server, such as a production server. A jump server can provide an additional layer of security and access control, as well as logging and auditing capabilities. A firewall is a device or software that filters and blocks unwanted network traffic based on predefined rules. A firewall can protect the internal network from external threats and limit the exposure of sensitive services and ports. A security analyst should recommend setting up a VPN and placing the jump server inside the firewall to improve the security of the remote desktop access to the production network. This way, the remote desktop service will not be exposed to the public network, and only authorized users with VPN credentials can access the jump server and then the production server."

      "D": "Non-repudiation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Confidentiality is the security concept that ensures data is protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. The principle of least privilege is a technique that grants users or systems the minimum level of access or permissions that they need to perform their tasks, and nothing more. By applying the principle of least privilege to a human resources fileshare, the permissions can be restricted to only those who have a legitimate need to access the sensitive data, such as HR staff, managers, or auditors. This can prevent unauthorized users, such as hackers, employees, or contractors, from accessing, copying, modifying, or deleting the data. Therefore, the principle of least privilege can enhance the confidentiality of the data on the fileshare. Integrity, availability, and non-repudiation are other security concepts, but they are not the best reason for permissions on a human resources fileshare to follow the principle of least privilege. Integrity is the security concept that ensures data is accurate and consistent, and protected from unauthorized modification or corruption. Availability is the security concept that ensures data is accessible and usable by authorized users or systems when needed. Non-repudiation is the security concept that ensures the authenticity and accountability of data and actions, and prevents the denial of involvement or responsibility. While these concepts are also important for data security, they are not directly related to the level of access or permissions granted to users or systems."

    "question": "Security controls in a data center are being reviewed to ensure data is properly protected and that human life considerations are included. Which of the following best describes how the controls should be set up?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Remote access points should fail closed.",
      "B": "Logging controls should fail open.",
      "C": "Safety controls should fail open.",
      "D": "Logical security controls should fail closed."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Safety controls are security controls that are designed to protect human life and physical assets from harm or damage. Examples of safety controls include fire alarms, sprinklers, emergency exits, backup generators, and surge protectors. Safety controls should fail open, which means that they should remain operational or allow access when a failure or error occurs. Failing open can prevent or minimize the impact of a disaster, such as a fire, flood, earthquake, or power outage, on human life and physical assets. For example, if a fire alarm fails, it should still trigger the sprinklers and unlock the emergency exits, rather than remain silent and locked. Failing open can also ensure that essential services, such as healthcare, transportation, or communication, are available during a crisis. Remote access points, logging controls, and logical security controls are other types of security controls, but they should not fail open in a data center. Remote access points are security controls that allow users or systems to access a network or a system from a remote location, such as a VPN, a web portal, or a wireless access point. Remote access points should fail closed, which means that they should deny access when a failure or error occurs. Failing closed can prevent unauthorized or malicious access to the data center's network or systems, such as by hackers, malware, or rogue devices. Logging controls are security controls that record and monitor the activities and events that occur on a network or a system, such as user actions, system errors, security incidents, or performance metrics. Logging controls should also fail closed, which means that they should stop or suspend the activities or events when a failure or error occurs. Failing closed can prevent data loss, corruption, or tampering, as well as ensure compliance with regulations and standards. Logical security controls are security controls that use software or code to protect data and systems from unauthorized or malicious access, modification, or destruction, such as encryption, authentication, authorization, or firewall. Logical security controls should also fail closed, which means that they should block or restrict access when a failure or error occurs. Failing closed can prevent data breaches, cyberattacks, or logical flaws, as well as ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An application allow list is a security technique that specifies which applications are authorized to run on a system and blocks all other applications. An application allow list can best protect against an employee inadvertently installing malware on a company system because it prevents the execution of any unauthorized or malicious software, such as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, or spyware. An application allow list can also reduce the attack surface and improve the performance of the system."

      "A": "Concurrent session usage",
      "B": "Secure DNS cryptographic downgrade",
      "C": "On-path resource consumption",
      "D": "Reflected denial of service"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A reflected denial of service (RDoS) attack is a type of DDoS attack that uses spoofed source IP addresses to send requests to a third-party server, which then sends responses to the victim server. The attacker exploits the difference in size between the request and the response, which can amplify the amount of traffic sent to the victim server. The attacker also hides their identity by using the victim's IP address as the source. A RDoS attack can target DNS servers by sending forged DNS queries that generate large DNS responses. This can flood the network interface of the DNS server and prevent it from serving legitimate requests from end users."

Firmware controls the basic functions and operations of the device, and can be updated or patched to fix bugs, improve performance, or enhance security. Firmware vulnerabilities are flaws or weaknesses in the firmware code that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, modify settings, or cause damage to the device or the network. A BIOS update is a patch that addresses a firmware vulnerability in the basic input/output system of a computer, which is responsible for booting the operating system and managing the communication between the hardware and the software.

    "options": {
      "A": "Obtain the file's SHA-256 hash.",
      "B": "Use hexdump on the file's contents.",
      "C": "Check endpoint logs.",
      "D": "Query the file's metadata."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Metadata is data that describes other data, such as its format, origin, creation date, author, and other attributes. Video files, like other types of files, can contain metadata that can provide useful information for forensic analysis. For example, metadata can reveal the camera model, location, date and time, and software used to create or edit the video file. To query the file's metadata, a security analyst can use various tools, such as MediaInfo, ffprobe, or hexdump, to extract and display the metadata from the video file. By querying the file's metadata, the security analyst can most likely identify both the creation date and the file's creator, as well as other relevant information. Obtaining the file's SHA-256 hash, checking endpoint logs, or using hexdump on the file's contents are other possible actions, but they are not the most appropriate to answer the question. The file's SHA-256 hash is a cryptographic value that can be used to verify the integrity or uniqueness of the file, but it does not reveal any information about the file's creation date or creator. Checking endpoint logs can provide some clues about the file's origin or activity, but it may not be reliable or accurate, especially if the logs are tampered with or incomplete. Using hexdump on the file's contents can show the raw binary data of the file, but it may not be easy or feasible to interpret the metadata from the hex output, especially if the file is large or encrypted."

    "options": {
      "A": "Console access",
      "B": "Routing protocols",
      "C": "VLANs",
      "D": "Web-based administration"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Web-based administration is a feature that allows users to configure and manage routers through a web browser interface. While this feature can provide convenience and ease of use, it can also pose a security risk, especially if the web interface is exposed to the internet or uses weak authentication or encryption methods. Web-based administration can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the router's settings, firmware, or data, or to launch attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Therefore, disabling web-based administration is a good practice to harden the routers within the corporate network. Console access, routing protocols, and VLANs are other features that can be configured on routers, but they are not the most appropriate to disable for hardening purposes. Console access is a physical connection to the router that requires direct access to the device, which can be secured by locking the router in a cabinet or using a strong password. Routing protocols are essential for routers to exchange routing information and maintain network connectivity, and they can be secured by using authentication or encryption mechanisms. VLANs are logical segments of a network that can enhance network performance and security by isolating traffic and devices, and they can be secured by using VLAN access control lists (VACLs) or private VLANs (PVLANs)."

A jump server can be used to securely access servers or devices that are not directly reachable from the user's workstation, such as database servers. A jump server can also provide audit logs and access control for the remote connections. A jump server is also known as a jump box or a jump host. RADIUS is a protocol for authentication, authorization, and accounting of network access. RADIUS is not a device or a method to access remote servers, but rather a way to verify the identity and permissions of users or devices that request network access. HSM is an acronym for Hardware Security Module, which is a physical device that provides secure storage and generation of cryptographic keys. HSMs are used to protect sensitive data and applications, such as digital signatures, encryption, and authentication. HSMs are not used to access remote servers, but rather to enhance the security of the data and applications that reside on them5 .

A buffer overflow can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code or commands into the application, which can compromise the security and functionality of the system. An organization's internet-facing website was compromised when an attacker exploited a buffer overflow. To best protect against similar attacks in the future, the organization should deploy a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF is a type of firewall that monitors and filters the traffic between a web application and the internet. A WAF can detect and block common web attacks, such as buffer overflows, SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more. A WAF can also enforce security policies and rules, such as input validation, output encoding, and encryption. A WAF can provide a layer of protection for the web application, preventing attackers from exploiting its vulnerabilities and compromising its data."

    "question": "An administrator notices that several users are logging in from suspicious IP addresses. After speaking with the users, the administrator determines that the employees were not logging in from those IP addresses and resets the affected users' passwords. Which of the following should the administrator implement to prevent this type of attack from succeeding in the future?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Multifactor authentication",
      "B": "Permissions assignment",
      "C": "Access management",
      "D": "Password complexity"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A because multifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of verifying a user's identity by requiring more than one factor, such as something the user knows (e.g., password), something the user has (e.g., token), or something the user is (e.g., biometric). MFA can prevent unauthorized access even if the user's password is compromised, as the attacker would need to provide another factor to log in. The other options are incorrect because they do not address the root cause of the attack, which is weak authentication. Permissions assignment (B) is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the user's role or identity. Access management is the process of controlling who can access what and under what conditions. Password complexity (D) is the requirement of using strong passwords that are hard to guess or crack, but it does not prevent an attacker from using a stolen password."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A dashboard is a graphical user interface that provides a visual representation of key performance indicators, metrics, and trends related to security events and incidents. A dashboard can help the board of directors to understand the number and impact of incidents that affected the organization in a given period, as well as the status and effectiveness of the security controls and processes. A dashboard can also allow the board of directors to drill down into specific details or filter the data by various criteria. A packet capture is a method of capturing and analyzing the network traffic that passes through a device or a network segment. A packet capture can provide detailed information about the source, destination, protocol, and content of each packet, but it is not a suitable way to present a summary of incidents to the board of directors. A vulnerability scan is a process of identifying and assessing the weaknesses and exposures in a system or a network that could be exploited by attackers. A vulnerability scan can help the organization to prioritize and remediate the risks and improve the security posture, but it is not a relevant way to report the number of incidents that occurred in a quarter14. Metadata is data that describes other data, such as its format, origin, structure, or context. Metadata can provide useful information about the characteristics and properties of data, but it is not a meaningful way to communicate the impact and frequency of incidents to the board of directors."

      "F": "Join the server to the corporate domain."
    },
    "answer": "AC",
    "explanation": "To perform server hardening before deployment, the administrator should disable default accounts and remove unnecessary services. These steps are crucial to reducing the attack surface and enhancing the security of the server. Disable default accounts: Default accounts often come with default credentials that are wellknown and can be exploited by attackers. Disabling these accounts helps prevent unauthorized access. Remove unnecessary services: Unnecessary services can introduce vulnerabilities and be exploited by attackers. Removing them reduces the number of potential attack vectors. Add the server to the asset inventory: Important for tracking and management but not directly related to hardening. Document default passwords: Documentation is useful, but changing or disabling default passwords is the hardening step. Send server logs to the SIEM: Useful for monitoring and analysis but not a direct hardening step. Join the server to the corporate domain: Part of integration into the network but not specific to hardening."

    "explanation": "A physical security control is a device or mechanism that prevents unauthorized access to a physical location or asset. An access control vestibule, also known as a mantrap, is a physical security control that consists of a small space with two sets of interlocking doors, such that the first set of doors must close before the second set opens. This prevents unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into the facility, a practice known as piggybacking or tailgating. A photo ID check is another form of physical security control that verifies the identity of visitors. Managerial, technical, and operational security controls are not directly related to physical access, but rather to policies, procedures, systems, and processes that support security objectives."

      "B": "Tokenization",
      "C": "Encryption",
      "D": "Segmentation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Encryption is a method of transforming data in a way that makes it unreadable without a secret key necessary to decrypt the data back into plaintext. Encryption is one of the most common and effective ways to protect data at rest, as it prevents unauthorized access, modification, or theft of the data. Encryption can be applied to different types of data at rest, such as block storage, object storage, databases, archives, and so on. Hashing, tokenization, and segmentation are not methods of rendering data at rest unreadable, but rather of protecting data in other ways. Hashing is a one-way function that generates a fixed-length output, called a hash or digest, from an input, such that the input cannot be recovered from the output. Hashing is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of data, but not to encrypt it. Tokenization is a process that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, called tokens, that have no meaning or value on their own. Tokenization is used to reduce the exposure and compliance scope of sensitive data, but not to encrypt it. Segmentation is a technique that divides a network or a system into smaller, isolated units, called segments, that have different levels of access and security. Segmentation is used to limit the attack surface and contain the impact of a breach, but not to encrypt data at rest."

    "explanation": "Mitigate is the risk management strategy that involves reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk. If a legacy application is critical to business operations and there are preventative controls that are not yet implemented, the enterprise should adopt the mitigate strategy first to address the existing vulnerabilities and gaps in the application. This could involve applying patches, updates, or configuration changes to the application, or adding additional layers of security controls around the application. Accept, transfer, and avoid are other risk management strategies, but they are not the best options for this scenario. Accept means acknowledging the risk and accepting the consequences without taking any action. Transfer means shifting the risk to a third party, such as an insurance company or a vendor. Avoid means eliminating the risk by removing the source or changing the process. These strategies may not be feasible or desirable for a legacy application that is critical to business operations and has no preventative controls in place."

      "A": "Red",
      "B": "Blue",
      "C": "Purple",
      "D": "Yellow"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Purple is the team that combines both offensive and defensive testing techniques to protect an organization's critical systems. Purple is not a separate team, but rather a collaboration between the red team and the blue team. The red team is the offensive team that simulates attacks and exploits vulnerabilities in the organization's systems. The blue team is the defensive team that monitors and protects the organization's systems from real and simulated threats. The purple team exists to ensure and maximize the effectiveness of the red and blue teams by integrating the defensive tactics and controls from the blue team with the threats and vulnerabilities found by the red team into a single narrative that improves the overall security posture of the organization. Red, blue, and yellow are other types of teams involved in security testing, but they do not combine both offensive and defensive techniques. The yellow team is the team that builds software solutions, scripts, and other programs that the blue team uses in the security testing."

    "options": {
      "A": "Using least privilege",
      "B": "Changing the default password",
      "C": "Assigning individual user IDs",
      "D": "Reviewing logs more frequently"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Changing the default password for the local administrator account on a VPN appliance is a basic security measure that would have most likely prevented the unexpected login to the remote management interface. Default passwords are often easy to guess or publicly available, and attackers can use them to gain unauthorized access to devices and systems. Changing the default password to a strong and unique one reduces the risk of brute-force attacks and credential theft. Using least privilege, assigning individual user IDs, and reviewing logs more frequently are also good security practices, but they are not as effective as changing the default password in preventing the unexpected login."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Patch availability most impacts an administrator's ability to address Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) discovered on a server. If a patch is not available for a discovered vulnerability, the administrator cannot remediate the issue directly through patching, which leaves the system exposed until a patch is released. Patch availability: Directly determines whether a discovered vulnerability can be fixed promptly. Without available patches, administrators must look for other mitigation strategies. Rescanning requirements: Important for verifying the effectiveness of patches but secondary to the availability of the patches themselves. Organizational impact: Considers the potential consequences of vulnerabilities but does not directly impact the ability to apply patches. Risk tolerance: Influences how the organization prioritizes addressing vulnerabilities but does not affect the actual availability of patches."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Effective change management procedures include having a backout plan when a patch fails. A backout plan ensures that there are predefined steps to revert the system to its previous state if the new change or patch causes issues, thereby minimizing downtime and mitigating potential negative impacts. Having a backout plan when a patch fails: Essential for ensuring that changes can be safely reverted in case of problems, maintaining system stability and availability. Approving the change after a successful deployment: Changes should be approved before deployment, not after. Using a spreadsheet for tracking changes: While useful for documentation, it is not a comprehensive change management procedure. Using an automatic change control bypass for security updates: Bypassing change control can lead to unapproved and potentially disruptive changes."

    "explanation": "To verify the integrity of downloaded files, a software developer should post hashes on the website. A hash is a fixed-length string or number generated from input data, such as a file. When users download the application files, they can generate their own hash from the downloaded files and compare it with the hash provided by the developer. If the hashes match, it confirms that the files have not been altered or corrupted during the download process. Hashes: Ensure data integrity by allowing users to verify that the downloaded files are identical to the original ones. Common hashing algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. Certificates and Algorithms: Are more related to ensuring authenticity and securing communications rather than verifying file integrity.

    "explanation": "When calculating risk ratings, the concepts of impact and likelihood are most likely to be considered. Risk assessment typically involves evaluating the potential impact of a threat (how severe the consequences would be if the threat materialized) and the likelihood of the threat occurring (how probable it is that the threat will occur). Impact: Measures the severity of the consequences if a particular threat exploits a vulnerability. It considers factors such as financial loss, reputational damage, and operational disruption. Likelihood: Measures the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. This can be based on historical data, current threat landscape, and expert judgment."

    "options": {
      "A": "Load balancing",
      "B": "Geographic disruption",
      "C": "Failover",
      "D": "Parallel processing"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To increase the resilience of an application by splitting the traffic between two identical sites, a systems administrator should set up load balancing. Load balancing distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers or sites, ensuring no single server becomes overwhelmed and enhancing the availability and reliability of applications. Load balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability. It helps in managing the load efficiently and can prevent server overloads. Geographic disruption: Not a standard term related to resilience. This might imply the use of geographically distributed sites but isn't the precise solution described. Failover: Refers to switching to a standby server or system when the primary one fails. It doesn't inherently split traffic but rather takes over when a failure occurs. Parallel processing: Refers to the simultaneous processing of tasks, not specifically related to load balancing web traffic."

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Given the scenario where an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has detected a high rate of SQL injection attacks and the perimeter firewall is at capacity, the best action would be to set the appliance to Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) mode and place it in front of the company firewall. This approach has several benefits: Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): Unlike IDS, which only detects and alerts on malicious activity, IPS can actively block and prevent those activities. Placing an IPS in front of the firewall means it can filter out malicious traffic before it reaches the firewall, reducing the load on the firewall and enhancing overall security. Reducing Traffic Load: By blocking SQL injection attacks and other malicious traffic before it reaches the firewall, the IPS helps maintain the firewall's performance and prevents it from becoming a bottleneck. Enhanced Security: The IPS provides an additional layer of defense, identifying and mitigating threats in real-time."

Understanding the current security policies provides a foundation for identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require improvement, ensuring that the security program aligns with the organization's goals and regulatory requirements. Review security policies: Provides a comprehensive understanding of the existing security framework, helping the new manager to identify gaps and areas for enhancement. Establish a security baseline: Important but should be based on a thorough understanding of existing policies and practices. Adopt security benchmarks: Useful for setting standards, but reviewing current policies is a necessary precursor. Perform a user ID revalidation: Important for ensuring user access is appropriate but not the first step in understanding overall security operations."

    "question": "A company is decommissioning its physical servers and replacing them with an architecture that will reduce the number of individual operating systems. Which of the following strategies should the company use to achieve this security requirement?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Microservices",
      "B": "Containerization",
      "C": "Virtualization",
      "D": "Infrastructure as code"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To reduce the number of individual operating systems while decommissioning physical servers, the company should use containerization. Containerization allows multiple applications to run in isolated environments on a single operating system, significantly reducing the overhead compared to running multiple virtual machines, each with its own OS. Containerization: Uses containers to run multiple isolated applications on a single OS kernel, reducing the need for multiple OS instances and improving resource utilization. Microservices: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which does not necessarily reduce the number of operating systems. Virtualization: Allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, but each VM requires its own OS, not reducing the number of OS instances. Infrastructure as code: Manages and provisions computing infrastructure through machinereadable configuration files, but it does not directly impact the number of operating systems."

    "question": "An organization wants to ensure the integrity of compiled binaries in the production environment. Which of the following security measures would best support this objective?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Input validation",
      "B": "Code signing",
      "C": "SQL injection",
      "D": "Static analysis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To ensure the integrity of compiled binaries in the production environment, the best security measure is code signing. Code signing uses digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software, ensuring that the code has not been tampered with or altered after it was signed. Code signing: Involves signing code with a digital signature to verify its authenticity and integrity, ensuring the compiled binaries have not been altered. Input validation: Ensures that only properly formatted data enters an application but does not verify the integrity of compiled binaries. SQL injection: A type of attack, not a security measure. Static analysis: Analyzes code for vulnerabilities and errors but does not ensure the integrity of compiled binaries in production."

    "options": {
      "A": "Encryption standard compliance",
      "B": "Data replication requirements",
      "C": "Least privilege",
      "D": "Access control monitoring"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The security administrator's actions of removing default permissions and adding permissions only for users who need access as part of their job duties best describe the principle of least privilege. This principle ensures that users are granted the minimum necessary access to perform their job functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. Least privilege: Limits access rights for users to the bare minimum necessary for their job duties, enhancing security by reducing potential attack surfaces. Encryption standard compliance: Involves meeting encryption requirements, but it does not explain the removal and assignment of specific permissions. Data replication requirements: Focus on duplicating data across different systems for redundancy and availability, not related to user permissions. Access control monitoring: Involves tracking and reviewing access to resources, but the scenario is about setting permissions, not monitoring them."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An unknown environment in penetration testing, also known as a black-box test, simulates an actual external attack where the tester has no prior knowledge of the system. This type of penetration test is designed to mimic real-world attack scenarios, where an attacker has little to no information about the target environment. The tester must rely on various reconnaissance and attack techniques to uncover vulnerabilities, much like a real-world attacker would. This approach helps organizations understand their security posture from an external perspective, providing insights into how their defenses would hold up against a true outsider threat."

A WAF specifically protects web applications by filtering, monitoring, and blocking HTTP requests based on a set of rules. This is crucial for preventing common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web-based attacks that could compromise the web service. Layer 4 firewall operates primarily at the transport layer, focusing on IP address and port filtering, making it unsuitable for web application-specific threats. NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall) provides more advanced filtering than traditional firewalls, including layer 7 inspection, but the WAF is tailored specifically for web traffic. UTM (Unified Threat Management) offers a suite of security tools in one package (like antivirus, firewall, and content filtering), but for web application-specific protection, a WAF is the best fit."

These scans assess an organization's network and systems for known vulnerabilities, including outdated or unsupported software (i.e., legacy systems) that may pose a security risk. The scan results can highlight systems that are no longer receiving updates, helping IT teams address these risks. Bug bounty programs are used to incentivize external researchers to find security flaws, but they are less effective at identifying legacy systems. Package monitoring tracks installed software packages for updates or issues but is not as comprehensive for identifying legacy systems. Dynamic analysis is typically used for testing applications during runtime to find vulnerabilities, but not for identifying legacy systems."

      "C": "Integrity",
      "D": "Non-repudiation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The scenario described, where client files are only accessible to employees who \"need to know\" the information, reflects the concept of confidentiality. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to those who are authorized to view it, preventing unauthorized access. Availability ensures that data is accessible when needed but doesn't focus on restricting access. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered but doesn't pertain to access control. Non-repudiation ensures that actions cannot be denied after they are performed, but this concept is unrelated to access control."

      "B": "Port security",
      "C": "IPS",
      "D": "NGFW"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Port security is the best mitigation technique for preventing an attacker from flooding the MAC address table of network switches. Port security can limit the number of MAC addresses learned on a port, preventing an attacker from overwhelming the switch's MAC table (a form of MAC flooding attack). When the allowed number of MAC addresses is exceeded, port security can block additional devices or trigger alerts. Load balancer distributes network traffic but does not address MAC flooding attacks. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) detects and prevents attacks but isn't specifically designed for MAC flooding mitigation. NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall) offers advanced traffic inspection but is not directly involved in MAC table security."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "In this scenario, employees are attempting to navigate to spoofed websites, which is being blocked by the web filter. To address this issue, the administrator should implement security awareness training. Training helps employees recognize phishing and other social engineering attacks, reducing the likelihood that they will attempt to access malicious websites in the future. Deploying multifactor authentication (MFA) would strengthen authentication but does not directly address user behavior related to phishing websites. Decreasing the level of the web filter would expose the organization to more threats. Updating the acceptable use policy may clarify guidelines but is not as effective as hands-on training for improving user behavior."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This example of a script injection attack would be best mitigated by input sanitization. Input sanitization involves cleaning or filtering user inputs to ensure that they do not contain harmful data, such as malicious scripts. This prevents attackers from executing script-based attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting or XSS). Nmap command is unrelated to input sanitization, as it is a network scanning tool. Email phishing attempts require different mitigations, such as user training. Browser warnings about insecure connections involve encryption protocols, not input validation."

    "explanation": "To block signature-based attacks, the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) must be in active mode. In this mode, the IPS can actively monitor and block malicious traffic in real time based on predefined signatures. This is the best mode to prevent known attack types from reaching the internal network. Monitor mode and sensor mode are typically passive, meaning they only observe and log traffic without actively blocking it. Audit mode is used for review purposes and does not actively block traffic."

      "A": "Tokenization",
      "B": "Hashing",
      "C": "Obfuscation",
      "D": "Segmentation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To limit the potential impact on the log-in database in case of a breach, the security team would most likely recommend hashing. Hashing converts passwords into fixed-length strings of characters, which cannot be easily reversed to reveal the original passwords. Even if the database is breached, attackers cannot easily retrieve the actual passwords if they are properly hashed (especially with techniques like salting). Tokenization is used to replace sensitive data with a token, but it is more common for protecting credit card data than passwords. Obfuscation is the process of making data harder to interpret but is weaker than hashing for password protection. Segmentation helps isolate data but doesn't directly protect the contents of the login database."

Firewall logs can reveal external communication, including outbound traffic to a command-and-control (C2) server. These logs would contain information about the IP addresses, ports, and protocols used, which can help in identifying suspicious connections. IPS logs may provide information about network intrusions, but firewall logs are better for tracking communication patterns. ACL logs (Access Control List) are useful for tracking access permissions but not for identifying C2 communication. Windows security logs would have been ideal if they had not been deleted."

    "question": "A security team is setting up a new environment for hosting the organization's on-premises software application as a cloud-based service. Which of the following should the team ensure is in place in order for the organization to follow security best practices?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Visualization and isolation of resources",
      "B": "Network segmentation",
      "C": "Data encryption",
      "D": "Strong authentication policies"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "When hosting an on-premises software application in a cloud-based service, ensuring visualization and isolation of resources is crucial for maintaining security best practices. This involves using virtualization techniques to create isolated environments (e.g., virtual machines or containers) for different applications and services, reducing the risk of cross-tenant attacks or resource leakage. Network segmentation is important but pertains more to securing network traffic rather than isolating computing resources. Data encryption is also essential but doesn't specifically address resource isolation in a cloud environment. Strong authentication policies are critical for access control but do not address the need for isolating resources within the cloud environment."

    "options": {
      "A": "Recovery",
      "B": "Preparation",
      "C": "Lessons learned",
      "D": "Containment"

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The lessons learned phase of an incident response process involves reviewing the incident and generating reports. This phase helps identify what went well, what needs improvement, and what changes should be made to prevent future incidents. Documentation and reporting are essential parts of this phase to ensure that the findings are recorded and used for future planning. Recovery focuses on restoring services and normal operations. Preparation involves creating plans and policies for potential incidents, not reporting. Containment deals with isolating and mitigating the effects of the incident, not generating reports."

    "question": "A business needs a recovery site but does not require immediate failover. The business also wants to reduce the workload required to recover from an outage. Which of the following recovery sites is the best option?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hot",
      "B": "Cold",
      "C": "Warm",
      "D": "Geographically dispersed"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A warm site is the best option for a business that does not require immediate failover but wants to reduce the workload required for recovery. A warm site has some pre-installed equipment and data, allowing for quicker recovery than a cold site, but it still requires some setup before becoming fully operational. Hot sites provide immediate failover but are more expensive and require constant maintenance. Cold sites require significant time and effort to get up and running after an outage. Geographically dispersed sites refer to a specific location strategy rather than the readiness of the recovery site."

    "options": {
      "A": "Compliance reporting",
      "B": "GDPR",
      "C": "Due diligence",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Due diligence refers to the process of researching and understanding the laws, regulations, and best practices that govern information security within a specific industry. Organizations are required to conduct due diligence to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which helps mitigate risks and avoid penalties. Compliance reporting involves generating reports to demonstrate adherence to legal or regulatory standards. GDPR is a specific regulation governing data privacy in the EU, not a general practice of researching laws. Attestation is a formal declaration that an organization is compliant with a set of standards but is not the act of researching the laws."

      "A": "To reduce implementation cost",
      "B": "To identify complexity",
      "C": "To remediate technical debt",
      "D": "To prevent a single point of failure"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Ensuring that other team members understand how a script works is essential to prevent a single point of failure. If only one person knows how the script operates, the organization risks being unable to maintain or troubleshoot it if that person is unavailable. Sharing knowledge ensures continuity and reduces dependence on one individual. Reducing implementation cost and remediating technical debt are secondary considerations in this context. Identifying complexity is important, but the main benefit is to avoid a single point of failure."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "To ensure that sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), is not modified, the bank should implement file integrity monitoring (FIM). FIM tracks changes to files and provides alerts if unauthorized modifications are detected, ensuring data integrity. Full disk encryption protects data at rest but does not prevent or monitor modifications. Network access control (NAC) manages access to the network but doesn't monitor file changes. User behavior analytics (UBA) detects suspicious user activities but is not focused on file integrit."

      "C": "End of support",
      "D": "End of life"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "When a legacy device is no longer receiving updates or patches, it is considered to be at the end of life (EOL). This means the manufacturer has ceased support for the device, and it will no longer receive updates, security patches, or technical assistance. EOL devices pose security risks and are often decommissioned or replaced. End of support may seem similar but typically refers to the cessation of technical support, whereas EOL means the device is fully retired. End of business and End of testing do not apply in this context."

      "B": "NGFW",
      "C": "VPN",
      "D": "Security zone"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is the best solution to allow remote employees secure access to company resources without interception concerns. A VPN establishes an encrypted tunnel over the internet, ensuring that data transferred between remote employees and the company is secure from eavesdropping. Proxy server helps with web content filtering and anonymization but does not provide encrypted access. NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall) enhances security but is not the primary tool for enabling remote access. Security zone is a network segmentation technique but does not provide remote access capabilities."

      "C": "False positive",
      "D": "False negative"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A false positive is an alert that incorrectly identifies benign activity as malicious. Over time, if an alerting system generates too many false positives, security teams are likely to ignore these alerts, resulting in \"alert fatigue.\" This increases the risk of missing genuine threats. True positives and true negatives are accurate and should be acted upon. False negatives are more dangerous because they fail to identify real threats, but they are not \"ignored\" since they do not trigger alerts."

      "A": "Penetration test",
      "B": "Internal audit",
      "C": "Attestation",
      "D": "External examination"

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "An external examination (also known as an external audit or external review) is the best method for the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to gain an understanding of how the company's security policies compare to external regulatory requirements. External examinations are conducted by third- party entities that assess an organization's compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards. Penetration tests focus on identifying vulnerabilities, not compliance. Internal audits assess internal controls but are not impartial or focused on regulatory requirements. Attestation is a formal declaration but does not involve the actual evaluation of compliance."

    "question": "A systems administrator notices that one of the systems critical for processing customer transactions is running an end-of-life operating system. Which of the following techniques would increase enterprise security?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Installing HIDS on the system",
      "B": "Placing the system in an isolated VLAN",
      "C": "Decommissioning the system",
      "D": "Encrypting the system's hard drive"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To enhance security for a system running an end-of-life operating system, placing the system in an isolated VLAN is the most effective approach. By isolating the system from the rest of the network, you can limit its exposure to potential threats while maintaining its functionality. This segmentation helps protect the rest of the network from any vulnerabilities in the outdated system. Installing HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System) can help detect intrusions but won't mitigate the risks posed by an unsupported OS. Decommissioning may not be feasible if the system is critical. Encrypting the system's hard drive protects data at rest but doesn't address vulnerabilities from an outdated OS."

Each application has a separate log-in. so the security team wants to reduce the number of credentials each employee must maintain. Which of the following is the first step the security team should take?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Enable SAML",
      "B": "Create OAuth tokens.",
      "C": "Use password vaulting.",
      "D": "Select an IdP"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The first step in reducing the number of credentials each employee must maintain when using multiple SaaS applications is to select an Identity Provider (IdP). An IdP provides a centralized authentication service that supports Single Sign-On (SSO), enabling users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. Enabling SAML would be part of the technical implementation but comes after selecting an IdP. OAuth tokens are used for authorization, but selecting an IdP is the first step in managing authentication. Password vaulting stores multiple passwords securely but doesn't reduce the need for separate logins."

      "C": "To continuously the monitor hardware inventory",
      "D": "To hunt for active attackers in the network"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Running daily vulnerability scans on all corporate endpoints is primarily done to track the status of patching installations. These scans help identify any missing security patches or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Keeping the endpoints up-to-date with the latest patches is critical for maintaining security. Finding shadow IT cloud deployments and monitoring hardware inventory are better achieved through other tools. Hunting for active attackers would typically involve more real-time threat detection methods than daily vulnerability scans."

      "B": "Default network device credentials",
      "C": "Spear phishing emails",
      "D": "Impersonation of business units through typosquatting"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Unidentified removable devices, such as USB drives, are a common threat vector for insider threat actors attempting data exfiltration. Insiders can easily use these devices to transfer sensitive data out of the organization undetected, making it one of the most commonly utilized methods for data theft. Default network device credentials are a security vulnerability but not typically used for data exfiltration. Spear phishing emails are used for external attacks, not insider data exfiltration. Impersonation through typosquatting is typically used by external actors for phishing or fraud."

Which of the following attack vectors is most likely being used?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Business email",
      "B": "Social engineering",
      "C": "Unsecured network",
      "D": "Default credentials"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The employee notices that the links in the email do not correspond to the company's official URLs, indicating that this is likely a social engineering attack. Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that may compromise security. Phishing emails, like the one described, often contain fraudulent links to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. Business email refers to business email compromise (BEC), which typically involves impersonating a high-level executive to defraud the company. Unsecured network is unrelated to the email content. Default credentials do not apply here, as the issue is with suspicious links, not login credentials."

      "B": "SPF",
      "C": "DLP",
      "D": "DMARC"

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "To mitigate the risk of sensitive data being exfiltrated from the environment, the IT manager should implement a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution. DLP monitors and controls the movement of sensitive data, ensuring that unauthorized transfers are blocked and potential data breaches are prevented. XDR (Extended Detection and Response) is useful for threat detection across multiple environments but doesn't specifically address data exfiltration. SPF (Sender Policy Framework) helps prevent email spoofing, not data exfiltration. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) also addresses email security and spoofing, not data exfiltration."
